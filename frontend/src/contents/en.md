## Announcing the Sunset of Chart Cyanvas

> _Someone said "ETA stands for End-of-Service Tomorrow Announcement." I hoped it was a joke..._

As you probably know, Chart Cyanvas faces ton of users right now. Sonolus is incredibly popular right now—it's even ranking up there with Sekai in Japan (lol).
That means we're seeing _a lot_ of users. My server has been trying to handle traffic on par with Sekai’s... and let’s be honest, that’s not something ["a random person in Nebraska"](https://xkcd.com/2347/) can manage. It’s gotten out of hand.

So, **I've made the difficult decision to discontinue Chart Cyanvas.** I'm truly sorry.

But this doesn’t mean the end of the Sekai fanmade community. Here’s what I’m planning going forward:

- Creating a **read-only archive** of Chart Cyanvas, like how Potato Leaves works for SweetPotato.
- Refunds for our supporters.
- A new Sonolus server project that **anyone can easily self-host**. I try to fit it in a single `.exe` file.

**This isn’t anyone’s fault.** It was a sinking ship from the start. **Please don’t blame anyone—not Burrito-san, not the chart creators, not anyone.**

Thank you, everyone, for all your support.
